This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploy on Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect this repository to Cloudflare Pages via GitHub import and point the build command to `npm run build && npm run pages:build`. That extra `pages:build` step runs `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` so the app can run inside Pages' service worker runtime.
2. Keep the output directory at `.next` so Cloudflare picks up the built assets, and make sure the root directory is the workspace root of this project.
3. Add any secrets (for third-party APIs, etc.) as Cloudflare Pages environment variables and redeploy; the app reads them just like it would locally.
4. To preview what Cloudflare Pages will serve, you can run `npx wrangler pages dev . --project-name your-project-name` and then commit/push once everything looks good.
